            <p>
                The <strong>electric guitar</strong> is an icon of modern music, an instrument whose voice can whisper, sing, or scream.
                Unlike its <a href="./acoustic-guitar.html">acoustic cousin</a>, it doesn't rely on a hollow body to be heard.
                Instead, its magic comes from technology, transforming the simple vibration of a steel string into a
                powerful sound that has defined generations.
            </p>

            <p>
                At its heart, the electric guitar is <strong>a partnership between wood, metal, and electricity</strong>.
                Magnetic pickups under the strings convert their movement into a weak electric signal.
                This signal is then sent to an amplifier, which boosts it into the massive, room-filling sound we know
                and love.
                This process unlocks a universe of tonal possibilities that an <a href="./acoustic-guitar.html">acoustic guitar</a> simply cannot achieve on
                its own.
            </p>

            <p>
                From the clean, shimmering chords of jazz to the raw power of rock and roll and the heavy crunch of
                metal, the electric guitar has been the driving force behind countless musical revolutions.
                This guide is your introduction to this incredible instrument.
                Here, you'll discover how it works, explore the different types of electric guitars, and learn about the
                essential gear that helps shape its legendary sound.

            <h2>How It Works: From String to Speaker</h2>

            <p>
                The secret to an electric guitar's sound lies in turning a string's vibration into an electrical signal.
                Unlike an <a href="./acoustic-guitar.html">acoustic guitar</a> that uses a hollow body to amplify sound, an electric guitar's solid body is
                designed to let the strings ring out for a long time (this is called <em>sustain</em>).
            </p>

            <h3>The Magnetic Pickup</h3>
            <p>
                Think of a <strong>pickup</strong> as a tiny microphone designed specifically for metal strings.
                It's a magnet wrapped in thousands of coils of thin wire.
                When you pluck a steel string, it vibrates and disturbs the pickup's magnetic field, creating a small
                electric current.
                This current is a perfect electronic copy of your note.
            </p>

            <h3>The Signal Chain</h3>
            <p>
                This tiny signal then travels out of your guitar through a cable on a journey to
                become sound.
                This path is called the signal chain, which is typically: <strong>Guitar → Pedals → Amplifier</strong>.
                The amplifier is the crucial last step, boosting the signal loud enough to be heard and adding its own
                distinct character to the tone.

            <h2>Electric Guitar Body Types</h2>

            <p>
                While electric guitars come in countless shapes, they mostly fall into three main families based on how
                their body is built.
                Each type has a unique sound and feel.
            </p>

                    Types of Electric Guitar Body Shapes

            </figure>

            <h3>Solid-Body</h3>
            <p>
                This is the most common type of electric guitar. Made from a solid slab of wood, it's a true workhorse.
                Its design is perfect for loud music because it resists feedback and has excellent sustain.
                This is the sound of rock, metal, pop, and country.
            </p>

            <h3>Hollow-Body</h3>
            <p>
                Built like an <a href="./acoustic-guitar.html">acoustic guitar</a>, a hollow-body has a completely empty interior.
                This gives it a warm, airy, and resonant tone that is beloved by jazz and vintage rockabilly players.
                However, at high volumes, the hollow body can vibrate uncontrollably, causing loud, undesirable
                feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Semi-Hollow Body</h3>
            <p>
                This design offers the best of both worlds.
                It has the hollow "<em>wings</em>" of a hollow-body but includes a solid block of wood running down the middle.
                This center block adds sustain and fights feedback, while the hollow portions provide a warm, woody
                character.
                It's an incredibly versatile choice for <strong>blues, rock, and jazz</strong>.
