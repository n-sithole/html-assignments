            <p>
                The <strong>classical guitar</strong>, also known as a <strong>Spanish guitar</strong>,
                is a member of the guitar family used in classical music and other styles.
                As an <strong>acoustic wooden string instrument</strong> with strings made of gut or nylon,
                it is a <em>precursor</em> of the modern <strong>steel-string acoustic</strong> and
                <strong>electric</strong> guitars, both of which use metal strings.
            </p>

            <p>
                <!-- Foreign terms in Spanish marked with lang for accessibility -->
                Classical guitars derive from instruments such as the lute, the <em lang="es">vihuela</em>,
                and the gittern (the name being a derivative of the Greek “kithara”), which evolved into
                the <strong>Renaissance guitar</strong> and into the 17th and 18th-century
                <strong>Baroque guitar</strong>. <strong>The modern classical guitar</strong>
                was established by the late designs of the 19th-century Spanish luthier,
                <strong>Antonio Torres Jurado</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The materials and methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but the typical
                shape is either the modern classical guitar or a historic classical guitar similar to
                the early <strong>Romantic</strong> guitars of Spain, France, and Italy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Classical guitar strings, once made of gut, are now made of materials such as
                <strong>nylon</strong> or fluoropolymers (especially PVDF), typically with silver-plated
                copper fine wire wound about the three lower-pitched strings (D, A, and low E in
                standard tuning).

            <h2>Physical characteristics and parts of the classical guitar</h2>

            <p>The classical guitar is distinguished by a number of characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Acoustic resonance:</strong> the sound of the plucked string is amplified
                    by the soundboard and the resonant cavity of the guitar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Six strings:</strong> though some classical guitars have seven or more strings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Nylon strings:</strong> all six strings are nylon (or nylon wound with metal),
                    unlike the metal strings on other acoustics. Nylon tension is <em>much lower</em> than
                    steel; the lower three “bass strings” are commonly wound with silver-plated copper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lighter structure:</strong> because of the low string tension, the neck can be
                    made entirely of wood without a steel truss rod, and interior bracing can be lighter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Neck width:</strong> typical modern six-string classical guitars are
                    <strong>48-54 mm</strong> wide at the nut, compared to around <strong>42 mm</strong>
                    for many electric guitars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fingerboard:</strong> normally flat and without inlaid fret markers (or dots only
                    on the side). Steel-string fingerboards usually have a slight radius and inlays.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Right-hand technique:</strong> classical guitarists use the right hand to pluck;
                    players may shape fingernails for a brighter tone and feel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Strumming:</strong> less common in classical; often referred to by the Spanish term
                    <em lang="es">rasgueo</em>, or for strumming patterns <em lang="es">rasgueado</em>, using the
                    backs of the fingernails.
                    <em lang="es">Rasgueado</em> is integral to <em lang="es">flamenco</em> guitar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Related design:</strong> the overall design of a classical guitar is similar to the
                    slightly lighter and smaller <em lang="es">flamenco</em> guitar.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fretboard</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>fretboard</strong> (also called the fingerboard) is a piece of wood embedded
                with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck. It is flat or slightly curved.
                The curvature is measured by the <strong>fretboard radius</strong>: the radius of a hypothetical
                circle of which the fretboard's surface is a segment. A smaller radius means a more noticeably
                curved board. Fretboards are most commonly made of <strong>ebony</strong>, but may also
                be made of <strong>rosewood</strong>, other hardwoods, or phenolic composite (“micarta”).
            </p>

            <h3>Frets</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Frets</strong> are metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded
                along the fingerboard at points that divide the string length mathematically. Pressing a
                string just behind a fret shortens its vibrating length to produce a higher pitch.
                Adjacent frets are spaced so each step is one semitone—the <strong>twelfth root of 2</strong>
                (≈ <em>1.059463</em>). The <strong>12th fret</strong> halves the string length (one octave),
                and the <strong>24th fret</strong> (if present) halves it again. Every twelve frets
                represents one octave, yielding the <strong>12-tone scale</strong> in equal temperament.
            </p>

            <h3>Neck</h3>
            <p>
                A classical guitar's <strong>neck</strong> comprises the frets, fretboard, tuners, and
                headstock on a long wooden extension. The fretboard wood usually differs from the rest
                of the neck. Bending stress on the neck can be considerable, particularly with heavier
                gauges. The most common scale length is <strong>650 mm</strong> (measured nut to 12th
                fret, doubled), though scale lengths from <strong>635-664 mm</strong> or more are used.
            </p>

            <h3>Neck joint or “heel”</h3>
            <p>
                This is where the neck meets the body. In the traditional Spanish neck joint, the neck
                and block are one piece, with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks
                are built separately and joined with a <strong>dovetail</strong>, <strong>mortise</strong>,
                or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and may be reinforced with mechanical fasteners.
                Many manufacturers now use <strong>bolt-on</strong> fasteners. Some believe Spanish one-piece
                neck/heel blocks and glued dovetails have better sustain, but tests have not confirmed this.
            </p>

            <h3>Body</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>body</strong> is a major determinant of the overall sound. The guitar top, or
                <strong>soundboard</strong>, is a finely crafted element often made of <strong>spruce</strong>
                or <strong>red cedar</strong>, about 2-3 mm thick, and strengthened by internal bracing.
                The back is often <strong>rosewood</strong> (Brazilian rosewood is especially coveted), though
                <strong>mahogany</strong> and other woods are also used.
            </p>

            <h3>Binding, purfling, and kerfing</h3>
            <p>
                The top, back, and sides are very thin, so a flexible piece of wood called <strong>kerfing</strong>
                (kerfed so it can bend) is glued where the rim meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement
                provides 5-20 mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints.
            </p>

            <h3>Bridge</h3>
            <p>
                The <strong>bridge</strong> transfers vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which
                vibrates the air inside the guitar, amplifying the sound. The bridge holds the strings on
                the body. The position of the <strong>saddle</strong>-a strip of bone or plastic that supports
                the strings—sets the distance to the nut and thus affects intonation.
            </p>

            <h2>Guitar tuning and the standard tuning</h2>
            <p>
                A variety of different tunings are used. The most common by far, which one could call the
                <strong>"standard tuning"</strong> is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>E' - B - G - D - A - E</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The order above runs from the <em>1st string</em> (highest-pitched, spatially the bottom string
                in playing position) to the <em>6th string</em> (lowest-pitched, spatially the upper string),
                which is comfortable to pluck with the thumb.
            </p>
