            <h2>Origins and history of the guitar</h2>
            <p>
                The origins of the <strong>modern guitar</strong> are <em>not known</em>. Before the development of the
                <strong>electric guitar</strong> and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as being an
                instrument having “a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often
                with incurved sides.”
            </p>

            <p>
                The term is used to refer to a number of <strong>chordophones</strong> that were developed and used
                across Europe, beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.
            </p>

            <p>
                A 3,300-year-old stone carving of a Hittite bard playing a stringed instrument is the <em>oldest
                    iconographic representation</em> of a chordophone, and clay plaques from Babylonia show people
                playing a lute-like instrument which is similar to the guitar.

                The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman <strong>cithara</strong>. The cithara was brought
                by the Romans to Spain around <time datetime="0040">AD 40</time>. In the 8th century the Moors brought
                the <strong>four-stringed oud</strong> into Spain. The introduction of the oud <em>caused changes</em>
                to the design of the cithara.
            </p>

            <p>
                In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian <strong>lute</strong> became popular
                wherever the Vikings had been. By <time datetime="1200">1200 AD</time>, there were two types
                of the <strong>four-string</strong> “guitar”: the <em lang="es">guitarra morisca</em>
                (Moorish guitar) from Spain, which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several sound
                holes, and the <em lang="es">guitarra latina</em> (Latin guitar), which was more like the modern
                guitar with one sound hole and a narrower neck.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Spanish <strong>vihuela</strong>, of the 16th century, was another instrument similar to the guitar.
                It had lute-style tuning and a body that was like a guitar. The vihuela was only popular for a
                <em>short time</em>. It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the
                oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, c. <time datetime="1850">1850</time>, the form and structure of the modern guitar were
                developed
                by several Spanish makers such as Manuel de Soto y Solares and, perhaps the most important of all guitar
                makers, <strong>Antonio Torres Jurado</strong>, who increased the size of the guitar body, altered its
                proportions, and invented the breakthrough <strong>fan-braced pattern</strong>.

                The <strong>electric guitar</strong> was made by <strong>George Beauchamp</strong> in
                <time datetime="1936">1936</time>. Beauchamp co-founded a company called
                <strong>Rickenbacker</strong> to make guitars. It was adopted by jazz guitar players,
                who wanted to play <em>single-note</em> guitar solos in large big band ensembles.
            </p>

            <p>
                Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include <strong>Les Paul</strong>,
                Eddie Durham, George Barnes, Lonnie Johnson, <strong>Sister Rosetta Tharpe</strong>,
                <strong>T-Bone Walker</strong>, and <strong>Charlie Christian</strong>. During the
                1950s and 1960s, the electric guitar became the <em>most important instrument</em>
                in popular music.
            </p>

            <p>
                Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of
                the neck, bridge, and pickups. Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring-loaded hinged bridge, which
                lets players “bend” the pitch of notes or chords up or down, or perform <em>vibrato effects</em>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by techniques such as <em>string bending</em>,
                <em>tapping</em>, and <em>hammer-ons</em>, using <em>audio feedback</em>, or <em>slide guitar</em>
                playing.
